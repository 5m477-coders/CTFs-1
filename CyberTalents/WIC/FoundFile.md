#### FoundFile

The challenge was a given file name `foundfile`

- Use `$ file foundfile` to know the type of file

You will find that it's a compiled Java class

- Change the file extension to `*.class*` to decompile it

- I used [Java Decompilers](http://www.javadecompilers.com/) Online

You will get the code

- Run the code .. I used [Java Compiler Online](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/compile_java_online.php)

Then You will get the flag ;)
