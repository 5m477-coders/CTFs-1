#### Help Ann

The challenge was a given corrupted file named `help_ann_please`

- Try to know the file type with `file help_ann_please` with no luck

- Try to open the file with Notepad .. it seems a PNG image

- So Let's Try to use `pngcheck` .. and it says `CORRUPTED by text conversion`

hmmmm .. good :-?

- Let's Open the file with HexaEditor ..

You will find that the `Magic number of the file not equal the Magic number of PNG `

- Modify the Magic number .. and that's it \:D/

- Scan the QR code with any scanner, You will get the flag ;)
